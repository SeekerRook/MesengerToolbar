# Messenger as a Sidebar (with Toolbar Toggler) for Firefox

## What it does

Allows it to run [Messenger](https://messenger.com) as a sidebar on your browser.
This is forked from [Newstack Digital Agency Meessenger as a Sidebar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/messenger-as-a-sidebar/) addon.
I just added the functionality of the Toolbar Icon.
